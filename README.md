### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Paul, a **full-stack software engineer** at [**@InvestorHub**](https://github.com/FreshXYZ). Previously, I was at [**@Xplor**](https://github.com/xplor) and [**@99designs**](https://github.com/99designs). I enjoy working on large-scale, impactful products, and have led and contributed to major customer-facing feature launches, and have also helped to improve internal infrastructure and tooling.

Outside of work, I'm interested in the latest developments in tech, games, and touching grass. 🐕☀️
