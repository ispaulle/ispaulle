### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm Paul, a **full-stack software engineer** at [**@InvestorHub**](https://github.com/FreshXYZ). Previously, I was at [**@Xplor**](https://github.com/xplor) and [**@99designs**](https://github.com/99designs), where I built and scaled impactful, customer-facing products and contributed to internal tooling improvements.

### 👾 Beyond Work

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about the latest developments in tech and like to unwind with games or by getting outside for a breath of fresh air. I'm also a proud dog parent to two furry companions. 🐕☀️
