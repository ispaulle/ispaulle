### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer at [**@InvestorHub**](https://github.com/FreshXYZ)

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and enjoy delving into topics such as system design, distributed systems and scalability. 

Outside of work, I like to follow the developments of science. I also have two fluffballs to take care of.
